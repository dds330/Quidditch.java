# Quidditch.java
The goal of this assignment is to simulate a simplified version of the soccer (Quidditch) game using object-oriented programming concepts in Java. 
The simulation involves a playing field, a quaffle (ball), and two players taking turns kicking the quaffle into the field.

The Demo class contains the main method where the Quidditch simulation takes place. It includes the creation of a field, a quaffle, and two player objects. 
The players take turns kicking the ball into the field for a total of 20 turns, with distances and angles specified for each kick.
The simulation outputs information about each player's kick, including the distance and angle, and whether the ball was reflected. The state of the quaffle after each kick is also displayed.
